# Changelog

A memory tool that could not say what changed between two of its own
states was the joke this file ends. Started 2026-09-08, after an
external review pointed out that a project built on "measured, not
guessed" had no record of its own history beyond `git log`.

Entries before that date are reconstructed from the commit history and
are therefore coarser than what follows. Where a day's work was
measured, the measurement is here rather than a summary of it.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Dates
are the day the work landed on `main`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Cloud and local stores found by name** (`src/stores.mjs`).
  `mem raw archive --list-stores` finds Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive
  and Dropbox on macOS, Windows and Linux, expanding the account
  wildcard those paths carry. `--set gdrive` then needs no path.
  Two candidates are reported as ambiguous rather than silently taking
  the first. A syncing store gets a warning naming all three
  consequences (eviction, no write barrier, shared use), attached to the
  path rather than to the command.
- **The archive** (`src/archive.mjs`). Raw captures live outside the
  repository; `raw-record.jsonl` stays tracked with one line per capture
  (stamp, span, line count, bytes, SHA-256, location, what was dropped).
  `mem raw archive`, `mem raw migrate`, `mem raw export --from/--to`
  with an optional hour window.
- **Machine-local archive location** (`.mem/archive.json`), set once via
  `mem raw archive --set`. `CHEAP_MEM_ARCHIVE` still wins for a single
  run; the report always names which of the three sources was used.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- A guard for the README's own numbers (`test/readme-zahlen.test.mjs`),
  because numbers in prose have no guard and therefore rot.

### Changed

- **Captures drop what is not conversation.** Measured over 21 real
  transcripts (41.30 MB): `attachment` lines are 51.7 % of the volume,
  and the largest item inside them is the task reminder, re-dumped
  nearly every turn. Same 16.5 MB transcript captured both ways:
  4.83 MB gzipped without the filter, 2.09 MB with it — **56.8 % less**.
  `thinking` is deliberately kept. Every capture header books what was
  dropped and why.

### Fixed

- **Redaction over-masked and reformatted while it did.** An env var
  *reference* was masked as if it were a value, and the separator around
  it was rewritten (a YAML colon came back as an equals sign). The
  digest reads these captures with a model, so this was corrupted source
  producing wrong facts, quietly.
- **A hook with a baked-in absolute path was dead on a second machine,
  and dead silently** — the session started without its memory and
  looked exactly like one that never had any. The root is now looked up,
  and a failed lookup says so and names the path. `MEM_HOOK_OFF=1`
  remains the only silent exit.
- **A transcript that shrank stopped being captured**, forever: the
  increment went negative and the capture reported "nothing new". (This
  one existed in the sibling project, not here — noted because the two
  are ported from each other and the asymmetry is the lesson.)

### Corrected

- The README claimed **"~500 lines of JS"** against a real ~18,900 —
  off by a factor of thirty-two — and **"all 17 MCP tools"** against a
  real 26. Neither was said on purpose; both were true once and nobody
  re-counted. For a project that argues for itself with honest
  self-description, that is the most expensive error available, so the
  counts now have a test.
- A historical measurement ("0 of 17 MCP tools" seen by three AI
  evaluations) is now dated, so it cannot be read as a current claim.

## 2026-09-08

The bridge caught up with the CLI: **20 → 26 MCP tools**, adding
heartbeats, open questions, procedures, sources, components and
neighbours. Provenance is stamped on every write by the server, never
accepted from the caller.

An id lane: asking for an entry id now returns that one entry. Reported
by a connected agent who wrote an entry over the bridge and could not
find it again — and the onboarding check had reported that route green,
because it queried a different lane.

Duplicate rate measured at **1.8 %**, and the raw figure that preceded
it was wrong.

## 2026-09-07

The error class asks itself at the moment of logging: entering one now
shows how often that class has occurred and when it last did.

## 2026-09-05

The largest single day (50 commits): the complete capability reference
in `docs/CAPABILITIES.md`, written after three AI evaluations read the
README and reported built features as missing.

## 2026-08-29 – 2026-09-03

Initial port from the private sibling project: the CLI, the entry types,
the inbox, the watcher, the MCP server, the install scripts, the Windows
port, CI on three platforms.
